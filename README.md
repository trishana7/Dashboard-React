# GuideLines for Project Setup

## Local Setup

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Dashboard-React repository to your local machine. You can use the following command to clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone <Dashboard-React-repo-url>
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory using the `cd` command:

   ```shell
   cd Dashboard-React
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server using the following command:

   ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```

This command will compile the project and start the development server. You should see the application running on your local machine.
